            "Content: Print Shop — Professional Printing Services in El Paso Since 1988, Universal Graphics, El Paso’s go-to print shop, has been at the center of the ever-changing printing industry. It began a generation ago. Founder Gil Lespron grew up watching his father busy at work in the printing press. He soon decided that the art and craft of print was something he was interested in. He too wanted to help people tell their stories through the printed word. Since then, the printing business has changed as the mechanisms and processes for creating print materials have vastly been impacted by technology. As an adept print shop, Universal Graphics has changed as well, adapting to the different technologies and printing trends but always dedicated to its customers and remaining a loyal part of the local community that made it possible. Today, Universal Graphics is a Woman-Owned, HUB-Certified print shop and is a member of the NPOA (National Print Owners Association), SGIA (Specialty Graphic Imaging Association), and ASI (Advertising Specialty Institute).
